## 📝 Description

A collection of classic and advanced data structure and algorithm implementations in C. Useful for learning, reference, and practice.

## Features

- Fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Core algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, etc.)
- Clean and well-documented C code

## ⚡ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/zeroisinfinity/DSA-C_Cpp.git
    ```
2. Compile the desired source file using [GCC's static analysis (`-fanalyzer`)](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html):
    ```sh
    gcc -fanalyzer filename.c -o output
    ./output
    ```
   Or, for regular compilation:
    ```sh
    gcc filename.c -o output
    ./output
    ```

## 📁 Folder Structure

- Each directory contains well-separated code for different data structures and algorithms.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request for improvements or new algorithms.
